HEX is played on a diamond-shaped board made up of hexagons. The number of
hexagons may vary, but the board usually has 11 on each edge. Two top and bottom
opposite sides of the diamond are labelled red, while the hexagons at the left
side and right side are green. One player playes with green pieces while other
with red. The plyers alternatively place one of their pieces on any one of the
hexagons, provided the cell is not already occupied by another piece.

The objective of the HEX game is to complete an unbroken chain of green pieces
between the left side and the right side. While red tries to complete a similar
chain of red pieces between the top side and the bottom side.

The chain may freely twist and turn. The players continue placing their pieces
until one of them has made a complete chain. The game cannot end in a draw,
because one player can block the other only by completing its own chain. These
rules are simple, yet HEX is a game of surprising mathematical subtlety.

In this computer game, computer always plays red. Green usually starts first
unless overridden. Left-click in a cell to place a green place. If you wish
computer to start first, right-click on any cell on the board.

Note: The computer does not play that well but would usually beat a novice
player.

The following commands are provide in the game:

-   **End Current Game**: End the current game and start a new one.
-   **Preset Board**: A new game starts with an empty board, but you can start a
    new game with some pieces preset. In preset mode, left-click to place a
    green piece, and right-click to place a red one.
-   **Start Preset Game**: Start playing the game with some pieces already set.
    The game starts by green placing its first piece.
-   **Exit**: Exit Hex program.
-   **Square Size**: The hex board is usually a diamond shape of 11x11 cells.
    However you can also play on a 11x10 or 12x11 etc board (a non square
    board). In a non-square board, green has a shorter path to make its chain.
-   **Increase/Decrease board size**. Maximum size is 21x21 or 21x20 and minimum
    size is 5x5 or 5x4.
-   **Help**: Displays this information.
