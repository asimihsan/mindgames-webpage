This program generates a maze for you to solve. Each maze generated has a unique
layout and only one open path from start to finish. You can also play a game
with the computer. Try and beat the computer by going from the bottom of the
maze to the top. The computer 'monster' will move from top to bottom. To win you
must avoid the monster and get to the top before the monster exits from the
maze.
