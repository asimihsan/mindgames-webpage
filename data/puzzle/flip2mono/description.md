### Introduction

Turn a grid to a single colour by flipping cells; cells colours change according
to the chosen pattern. This is a good mind stretcher during a coffee break. The
puzzle is however very hard, not every body's cup of tea.

### How to Play

-   Select a pattern according to which the colours will be flipped
-   Create a new puzzle of size 4x4 or 5x5
-   Two colours - normal and target are selected for the puzzle (can be changed
    by the user). Say Red and Green as an example.
-   Puzzle will be presented with two fixed cells marked as X and of normal
    colour Red
-   Target is to change all blank cells to the target colour Green. When puzzle
    is solved the X cells must be normal colour. A solved puzzle will be all
    green except the two X cells being Red.
-   Click a cell to flip. When a cell is flipped, the surrounding cells as
    determined by the chosen pattern, will change colour. Green will change to
    Yellow and reverse, and blank will change to normal color red.
-   Leftclick to flip a cell. Rightclick and hold to see the outcome and assess
    the results of a flip.
-   Cannot flip a blank cell, must change it to a colour first. This would
    happen as you flip cells around it. Cells marked X can be flipped.
-   Continue flipping until all blank cells are of the target colour green.
    Cells marked X must in the end be in the normal colour Red in the solution.
-   Computer already has a solution for the puzzle. The computer solution is
    however not optimum. A human player using visual inspection should be able
    to solve in a fraction of the moves taken by the computer.
-   Each puzzles has a solution
