### Introduction

This program will create and print mazes of size 9x9 to 36x36. You solve the
maze by tracing a path from the start to the exit location in the maze. Default
start location is middle of the maze. Exit location is one of the cells at the
border of the maze. Usually you would print a puzzle and solve on paper. However
you can also play against the computer to reach the exit location faster.
