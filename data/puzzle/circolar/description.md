### Introduction

Rotate three rings to align three segments of same colours. Each ring has eight
segments. Three colours are distrubuted randomly in each segement with some
colours duplicated. As you rotate a ring left or right, all colours in it rotate
accordingly. You are required to get three segments, each of a different colour
aligned correctly.

With careful thinking any random puzzle can be solved in
three to four rotations. Note that a solution must have three segments of three
different colours.
