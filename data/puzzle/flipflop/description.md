### Introduction

Flip all discs to a given colour. The board starts with a set of discs placed on
a grid. Discs are of two colours. When you flip a disc, the disc and its four
neighboring discs are changed to the opposite colour. A disc can be flipped once
only. Puzzle is solved when all the discs are of the same target colour. See
screen shot below:

Consider part of a grid as below (B=Black disc, R=Red disc). You are required to
change all RED discs to BLACK:

        R
        |
    R---B---R
        |
        B

Clicking B in the middle will change the board to:

        B
        |
    B---R---B
        |
        R

Note that a disc, once clicked cannot be used again to flip colours of its
neighboring discs.
