Fill a grid such that cross cells at any location are in sequence.  Cross cells are left and right, and, top and bottom of a cell.  Sequence is a mathematical sequence like 1,2,3 or 4,6,8 or 1,5,9 etc.  There are no duplicate numbers in any row or any column of the grid.  Some cells are given and some may be blacked out (not part of a sequence).  Puzzle size is 5x5 to 9x9.  Each puzzle has a unique solution that can be reached by logic alone without any guesswork.
