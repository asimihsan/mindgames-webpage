# Issues found with Mindgames

## 2ordie

-   When you have a number with more than two digits it is not possible to
    remove just the right-most digit. Clicking "R" truncates all but the left-
    most digit.

## arrowheads

-   Clicking on the green start icon or any other square with a number gives a
    message "Run-time error '424': Object required".

## masyu

-   Right clicking doesn't delete existing bridges

## maze

-   The maze shortcut installed in the start menu doesn't work. It points at
"C:\Program Files\maze\maze.exe" but it needs to point at
"C:\Program Files\maze\maz2.exe".
